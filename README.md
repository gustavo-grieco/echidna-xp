This is an **eXPerimental Echidna fork**, created by me, [Gustavo Grieco](https://gustavo-grieco.github.io/). I was one of the original [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) lead developers while working at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). Today, I work as an independent blockchain security researcher.
 
## Features and Goals

As the name suggests, this fork focuses on adding experimental features, primarily related to:

* [Extended symbolic execution capabilities and hybrid fuzzing using **hevm**](https://gustavo-grieco.github.io/blog/echidna-symexec/)  
* Improved mutation scheduling via **multi-armed bandits**  
* LLM integration through **MCP capabilities**

Additionally, this fork aims to:

* Enable extensive benchmarking with real fuzzing campaigns  
* Reduce code complexity and remove legacy or unused features

All code developed here will eventually be merged [upstream](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) and made available in official releases. You can see [here the list of all PRs from this fork](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Agustavo-grieco+sort%3Aupdated-desc).

## Funding

Development is currently seeking funding opportunities. A [donation wallet is available](https://github.com/gustavo-grieco/echidna-xp/blob/readme/FUNDING.json#L4), or you can [contact me](https://forms.gle/V3jt7C2JQgZhoXfe9) to discuss alternative ways to support the project.
